# whatsapp-api-google-app-script
A Whatsapp's Official API helper for Google App Script

## Notice
Now the main code comes from Secreto31126/whatsapp-api-js, which I turn into a Google App Script library. The implementation is almost the same as the main repository, so read that documentation.

## The Library code
```

```

## How to redeem this code
On your Google Script proyect, on the left side menu there's a library section. Click on the +, paste the code, set the identifier as WhatsApp, hit Add, and you are ready to go!

## How to get the main export
Simply call `WhatsApp.getWhatsApp()`, which will return the main export object, just like using `request("whatsapp-api-js")` in the Node version of the code.
